Draw a hexagonal grid in Xojo

This is an older version of the Hexagonal Grid in Xojo. A newer version of code is available at: https://github.com/eugenedakin/Hexagonal-Grid-Xojo-Version-2

This article is an adaptation of C# code to Xojo code and the C# article was originally written by Rod Stephens "Draw a hexagonalgrid in C#". Rows and columns are numbered in a hexagonal grid when the rows start at zero at the top, and increase as you go near the bottom. Columns start at zero at the left and the value increases as you move to the right. Below is a screen grab of the hexagonal grid. More information is available on my website at:

This was created with Xojo 2019 v1.1
